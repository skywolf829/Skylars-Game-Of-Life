# Skylars-Game-Of-Life
This is a java implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Using Java.awt and Java.swing, I created a GUI that allows for manipulation of the game board, and options to adjust the sizing. Players can step through the game, or have it automatically finish at a speed chosen.

This was created over winter break of 2015 as a fun side project.
